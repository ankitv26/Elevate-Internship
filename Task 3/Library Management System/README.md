# 📚 Library Management System

A mini console-based system to manage books and users using Java and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

---

## 💡 Objective

- Managing a collection of books
- Managing users
- Issuing and returning books

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Java
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- Terminal / Command Prompt

## 🔑 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

    | Concept        | Description                                      |
    |----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
    | Abstraction     | Classes hide internal logic and expose behavior |
    | Encapsulation   | Fields are private; accessed via getters/setters |
    | Inheritance     | Ready to be extended for admin/librarian roles  |
    | Polymorphism    | Overriding methods enables behavior flexibility |
